## Projects

### [LLM Agents in Social Network Dynamics: A Study on Information Flow and Propagation](https://medium.com/@blamichhane314/llm-agents-in-social-network-dynamics-a-study-on-information-flow-6796d1107297) | **Fall 2023**

- **Overview**: Developed a framework aimed at analyzing the flow of information within social networks. This involved the use of generative agents to simulate social interactions, employing a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to structure these interactions efficiently. A scoring mechanism  was designed to evaluate the dynamics of information propagation within the network, providing insights into how information spreads in social settings powered by artificial agents.

### [Exploring Relationships Between Network Properties: A Regression Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zh2tkKHuKDTECH-Ijt_p2Sp3vEtIkHpu/view?usp=share_link) | **Fall 2023**

- **Overview**: Conducted a detailed investigation into how various graph models and node properties influence the robustness of networks. This project focused on understanding the underlying dynamics that contribute to network stability and efficiency.
